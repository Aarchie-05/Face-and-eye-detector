This is an application built with the concept of object detection in python using open source computer vision library and Haar cascade algorithm. Face and eye detector can detect multiple faces and can also detect eyes.

### OpenCV

Open source computer vision library is an open source computer vision and machine learning library. It was built with a vision to provide basic infrastructure to the computer vision application.

### Haar Cascade Algorithm

It is a machine learning algorithm used to identify objects in image or video. I have used a Face cascade and Eye cascade.
